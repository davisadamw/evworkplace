\title{Create charging probabilities}
\usage{
make_workcharge_probs(
  use_BEV = TRUE,
  single_family_home_frac = 0.9,
  sfh_homecharge = 0.9,
  mud_homecharge = 0.2,
  is_workcharge_free = FALSE,
  rate_paid = 12.97,
  long_range_wt = 0.5,
  medium_range_wt = 0.4,
  short_range_wt = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{use_BEV}{Use BEV charging probabilities? Otherwise use PHEV probabilities.}

\item{single_family_home_frac}{Fraction of all electric vehicles owned by households in single-family homes}

\item{sfh_homecharge}{Home charging availability in single-family homes, keep it between 0-1}

\item{mud_homecharge}{Home charging availability in multi-unit dwellings, keep it between 0-1}

\item{is_workcharge_free}{Is charging free at commute destinations? \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}}

\item{rate_paid}{Electrical rate paid for home charging, keep it between 10-25 cents/kWh}

\item{long_range_wt}{Share of long-range vehicles, BEV range 220+ miles, PHEV range 80+ miles}

\item{medium_range_wt}{Share of medium-range vehicles, BEV range 120 miles, PHEV range 35 miles}

\item{short_range_wt}{Share of short-range vehicles, BEV range 85 miles, PHEV range 20 miles

Fraction of short range vehicles, BEV range 75 miles, PHEV range 15 miles}
}
\value{
A data frame of charging probabilities per commute distance to use in \code{\link{assign_workcharge}}
}
\description{
This function subsets the included charging probabilities to create a single charging scenario.
}
\details{
Note: All fractions should be kept between 0-1, but the vehicle range weights can also be expressed as any positive number
}
\examples{
# Make a set of charging probabilities each for BEVs and PHEVs using the default values
bev_chargeprob  <- make_workcharge_probs()
phev_chargeprob <- make_workcharge_probs(use_BEV = FALSE)

# create a set of probabilities for free work charging
bev_chargeprob_wfree <- make_workcharge_probs(is_workcharge_free = TRUE)
}

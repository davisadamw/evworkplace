# evworkplace

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of evworkplace is to make it easy to estimate workplace charging demand for an EV adoption scenario produced using the stocked package. Charging demand is estimated using a simplified version of the model developed in Chakraborty, D., Bunch, D. S., Lee, J. H., & Tal, G. (2019) "Demand drivers for charging infrastructure-charging behavior of plug-in electric vehicle commuters." in *Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment*. This paper can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920919301919).

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("davisadamw/evworkplace")
```

Installing this package should install the required package [stocked](https://github.com/davisadamw/stocked) automatically, but if not it can be installed with:
``` r
devtools::install_github("davisadamw/stocked")
```


## Example

_in progress_

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(evworkplace)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
